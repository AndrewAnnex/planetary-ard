> The SpatioTemporal Asset Catalog (STAC) specification provides a common language to describe a range of geospatial information, so it can more easily be indexed and discovered. A 'spatiotemporal asset' is any file that represents information about ~~the earth~~ _any planetary body_ captured in a certain space and time. [About STAC](https://stacspec.org)

This tutorial is a little less hands on than the other tutorials. At the end of this tutorial, you will know the differences between a STAC catalog, collection, and item. You will also know how to quickly scan a STAC metadata file and find the information pertinent to the questions you are seeking to answer.

## Catalogs, Collections, Items, and APIs, oh my!
The STAC documentation provides a great description of the four primary components that collectively make up the STAC specification. Instead of repeating all of that great work, [take a moment to read up on the four different STAC components](https://stacspec.org/core.html).
