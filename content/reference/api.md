In this section, the STAC Specification API is described. The STAC API Spec is an OpenAPI3 compliant specification. If you are unfamiliar with OpenAPI specification descriptions, below you will see two sections: Endpoints (Capabilities, Data, and STAC) that can be accessed at a given URL and schemas (collection, collections, confClasses, etc.) that document the inputs and outputs to the API.
