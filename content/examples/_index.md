These are our examples or [how-to guides](https://documentation.divio.com/how-to-guides/). Some ideas include:

- How to search for data, in a Jupyter notebook, based on a specific metadata field programatically.
  - How to visualize the discovered data in a Jupyter notebook.
  - How to load different assets into a GIS.
  - Once we have a prototype UI, how to do discovery and possibly visualization in a web browser.
