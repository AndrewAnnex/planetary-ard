This is a section for [explinations](https://documentation.divio.com/explanation/).

Ideas for this section include:

- How are stereo DTMs generated?
- What are some considerations before using these data?
- What do different metadata fields describe about the data? - is this reference? Maybe? Does this have an explination component?
- Where are we going from here? What are ways to contribute to the project? We want to collaborate, etc.
